# TODO

## Kotlin language

1. class parameters / constructor
    - val's are also propertys
    - vals have visibility modifier
    - Parameter -> ClassParameter?
2. secondary constructor see MeshTriangle
3. open fun f()
4. private constructor

- star imports - warning?
-  

## Bugs

- a property called property has a PROPERTY node
- companion objects
- anonymous objects?
- inline functions
- reified type parameters
- by, delegate, lazy properties
- infix
- lambda with receiver, fun with receiver

## Ideas

The following json contains the analysis of Kotlin code. For every package it contains the number of elements in it. First step: analyse the statistics. Second step: what about this software?
